Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/past-projects/project2&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1597596784944000&usg=AOvVaw1ihTzKFunxKsL2f6sIYdlC).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Smacks 'n Snacks
An app for viewing recipes, ordering food and purchasing a meal plan through Chef D. I will actually be building this for real world use. I plan to have a home page, a page for meal plan options, a page for food to be ordered and a contact page. Food will be available for delivery, so i will use the mapbox API. https://account.mapbox.com/
User Stories

As a user, I want to log in so I can place an order.
As a user, I want to be able to see everything available, so I can choose what to order.
As a user, I want to link to Venmo or PayPal, so my transaction is secure.
As a user, I want to have contact info for this app, so I know how to reach out with a problem.
2. Really Bad Karaoke
An App that lets you sing karaoke, but the lyrics are provided by an api and then passed through atranslation api(after passing them through multiple languages).
https://english.api.rakuten.net/systran/api/systran-io-translation-and-nlp/details
https://rapidapi.com/PlanetTeamSpeak/api/mourits-lyrics?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Alpha_107209115510&utm_term=lyrics%20api_e&gclid=CjwKCAjwps75BRAcEiwAEiACMbAroFGiXWuOvIHUDgpzlatXDmGNsNslo_blyaZP5zMfhYFO9cQrvBoCt6sQAvD_BwE

3. Space for Kids
An app that allows parents to log in and find age targeted material about space and the NASA space program.

As a user, I want to be able to create an account (as a parent) and allow my child to learn age appropriate material.
As a user, I want to be able to delete my account at any time.
As a user, I want my child to have the ability to understand and navigate the app.
